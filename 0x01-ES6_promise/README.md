# ES6 Promises Project

This project involves using ES6 Promises to manage asynchronous operations in JavaScript. You'll be implementing various functions to handle and test Promises, covering concepts like error handling, `async`/`await`, and more.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand and use Promises (`then`, `catch`, `resolve`, `reject`).
- Handle errors with `throw`, `try`, `catch`.
- Use `async` and `await` for cleaner asynchronous code.

## Requirements
- NodeJS 12.11.x
- Use `.js` extension for files.
- Code must be tested with Jest and linted with ESLint.

## Setup
**Install NodeJS:**
   ```bash
   curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
   sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh
   sudo apt install nodejs -y
